1. What versions are you using?

<!--

Give your database version.


Also run Python and show the output of:

    import sys
    import platform

    print("platform.platform:", platform.platform())
    print("sys.maxsize > 2**32:", sys.maxsize > 2**32)
    print("platform.python_version:", platform.python_version())

And:

    import oracledb
    print("oracledb.__version__:", oracledb.__version__)

-->

2. Is it an error or a hang or a crash?

3. What error(s) or behavior you are seeing?

<!--

Cut and paste text showing the command you ran.  No screenshots.

-->

4. Include a runnable Python script that shows the problem.

<!--

Include all SQL needed to create the database schema.

Format code by using three backticks on a line before and after code snippets, for example:

```
import python-oracledb
```
