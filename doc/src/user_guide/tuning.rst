***********************
Tuning python-oracledb
***********************

Some general tuning tips are:

* Tune your application architecture.

  A general application goal is to reduce the number of :ref:`round-trips
  <roundtrips>` between python-oracledb and the database.

  For multi-user applications, make use of connection pooling.  Create the pool
  once during application initialization.  Do not oversize the pool, see
  :ref:`connpooling` .  Use a session callback function to set session state, see
  :ref:`Session Callbacks for Setting Pooled Connection State <sessioncallback>`.

  Make use of efficient python-oracledb functions.  For example, to insert
  multiple rows use :meth:`Cursor.executemany()` instead of
  :meth:`Cursor.execute()`.

* Tune your SQL statements.  See the `SQL Tuning Guide
  <https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=dblatest&id=TGSQL>`__.

  Use :ref:`bind variables <bind>` to avoid statement reparsing.

  Tune :attr:`Cursor.arraysize` and :attr:`Cursor.prefetchrows` for each query,
  see :ref:`Tuning Fetch Performance <tuningfetch>`.

  Do simple optimizations like :ref:`limiting the number of rows <rowlimit>` and
  avoiding selecting columns not used in the application.

  It may be faster to work with simple scalar relational values than to use
  Oracle Database object types.

  Make good use of PL/SQL to avoid executing many individual statements from
  python-oracledb.

  Tune the :ref:`Statement Cache <stmtcache>`.

  Enable :ref:`Client Result Caching <clientresultcache>` for small lookup tables.

* Tune your database.  See the `Database Performance Tuning Guide
  <https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=dblatest&id=TGDBA>`__.

* Tune your network.  For example, when inserting or retrieving a large number
  of rows (or for large data), or when using a slow network, then tune the
  Oracle Network Session Data Unit (SDU) and socket buffer sizes, see
  `Configuring Session Data Unit
  <https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=dblatest&id=GUID-86D61D6F-AD26-421A-BABA-77949C8A2B04>`__
  and `Oracle Net Services: Best Practices for Database Performance and High
  Availability
  <https://static.rainfocus.com/oracle/oow19/sess/1553616880266001WLIh/PF/
  OOW19_Net_CON4641_1569022126580001esUl.pdf>`__.

  In python-oracledb Thick mode the SDU size is configured in the
  :ref:`optnetfiles`. In python-oracledb Thin mode, the SDU size can be passed
  as a connection or pool creation parameter.  In both modes it may optionally
  be set in the connection :ref:`Easy Connect string <easyconnect>` or
  :ref:`connect descriptor <netservice>`.

* Do not commit or rollback unnecessarily.  Use :attr:`Connection.autocommit`
  on the last of a sequence of DML statements.

* If Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is limiting
  :ref:`concurrent program performance <asyncio>`, then explore using parallel
  Python processes.

.. _tuningfetch:

Tuning Fetch Performance
========================

To tune queries, you can adjust python-oracledb's internal buffer sizes to
improve the speed of fetching rows across the network from the database, and to
optimize memory usage.  This can reduce :ref:`round-trips <roundtrips>` which
helps performance and scalability.  Tune "array fetching" with
:attr:`Cursor.arraysize` and tune "row prefetching" with
:attr:`Cursor.prefetchrows`.  Set these before calling
:meth:`Cursor.execute()`.  The value used for prefetching can also be set in an
``oraaccess.xml`` file, see :ref:`optclientfiles`.  In python-oracledb Thick
mode, the internal buffers allocated for ``prefetchrows`` and ``arraysize`` are
separate, so increasing both settings will require more Python process memory.
Queries that return LOBs and similar types will never prefetch rows, so the
``prefetchrows`` value is ignored in those cases.

The internal buffer sizes do not affect how or when rows are returned to your
application regardless of which :ref:`python-oracledb method <fetching>` is
used to fetch query results.  They do not affect the minimum or maximum number
of rows returned by a query.

The difference between row prefetching and array fetching is when the internal
buffering occurs.  Internally python-oracledb performs separate "execute SQL
statement" and "fetch data" steps.  Prefetching allows query results to be
returned to the application when the acknowledgment of successful statement
execution is returned from the database.  This means that the subsequent
internal "fetch data" operation does not always need to make a round-trip to
the database because rows are already buffered in python-oracledb or in the
Oracle Client libraries.  An overhead of prefetching when using the
python-oracledb Thick mode is the need for additional data copies from Oracle
Client's prefetch buffer when fetching the first batch of rows.  This cost may
outweigh the benefits of using prefetching in some cases.

Choosing values for ``arraysize`` and ``prefetchrows``
------------------------------------------------------

The best :attr:`Cursor.arraysize` and :attr:`Cursor.prefetchrows` values can be
found by experimenting with your application under the expected load of normal
application use. The reduction of round-trips may help performance and overall
system scalability. The documentation in :ref:`round-trips <roundtrips>` shows
how to measure round-trips.

Here are some suggestions for tuning:

* To tune queries that return an unknown, large, number of rows, estimate the
  number of rows returned and increase the :attr:`Cursor.arraysize` value for
  best performance, memory and round-trip usage.  The default is 100.  For
  example:

  .. code-block:: python

      cur = connection.cursor()

      cur.arraysize = 1000

      for row in cur.execute("SELECT * FROM very_big_table"):
          print(row)

  In general for this scenario, leave ``prefetchrows`` at its default value.
  If you do change it, then set ``arraysize`` as big, or bigger.  Do not make
  the sizes unnecessarily large.

* If you are fetching a fixed number of rows, set ``arraysize`` to the number
  of expected rows, and set ``prefetchrows`` to one greater than this value.
  Adding one removes the need for a round-trip to check for end-of-fetch.  For
  example, if you are querying 20 rows, perhaps to :ref:`display a page
  <rowlimit>` of data, then set ``prefetchrows`` to 21 and ``arraysize`` to 20:

  .. code-block:: python

      cur = connection.cursor()

      cur.prefetchrows = 21
      cur.arraysize = 20

      for row in cur.execute("""
          SELECT last_name
             FROM employees
             ORDER BY last_name
             OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH NEXT 20 ROWS ONLY"""):
          print(row)

  This will return all rows for the query in one round-trip.

* If you know that a query returns just one row then set :attr:`Cursor.arraysize`
  to 1 to minimize memory usage.  The default prefetch value of 2 allows minimal
  round-trips for single-row queries:

  .. code-block:: python

      cur = connection.cursor()

      cur.arraysize = 1

      cur.execute("select * from MyTable where id = 1"):
      row = cur.fetchone()
      print(row)

The following table shows the number of round-trips required to fetch various
numbers of rows with different ``prefetchrows`` and ``arraysize`` values.

.. list-table-with-summary::  Effect of ``prefetchrows`` and ``arraysize`` on the number of round-trips
    :header-rows: 1

    :summary: The first column is the number of rows used for the example.  The second column is the prefetchrows value.  The third column is the arraysize value.  The final column shows how many round-trips it would take to fetch all data from the database.

Application Default Prefetchrows and Arraysize Values
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Application-wide defaults can be set using :attr:`defaults.prefetchrows` and
:attr:`defaults.arraysize`, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    import oracledb

    oracledb.defaults.prefetchrows = 1000
    oracledb.defaults.arraysize    = 1000

When using python-oracledb in the Thick mode, prefetching can also be tuned in
an external :ref:`oraaccess.xml <optclientfiles>` file, which may be useful for
tuning an application when modifying its code is not feasible.

Setting the sizes with ``oracledb.defaults`` attributes or with
``oraaccess.xml`` will affect the whole application, so it should not be the
first tuning choice.

Changing Prefetchrows and Arraysize for Re-executed Statements
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In python-oracledb, the ``arraysize`` and ``prefetchrows`` values are only
examined when a statement is executed the first time.  To change the values for
a re-executed statement, create a new cursor.  For example, to change
``arraysize``:

.. code-block:: python

    array_sizes = (10, 100, 1000)
    for size in array_sizes:
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        cursor.arraysize = size
        start = time.time()
        cursor.execute(sql).fetchall()
        elapsed = time.time() - start
        print("Time for", size, elapsed, "seconds")

Avoiding Premature Prefetching
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There are two cases that will benefit from setting ``prefetchrows`` to zero:

* When passing a python-oracledb cursor *into* PL/SQL.  Setting
  ``prefetchrows`` to 0 can stop rows being prematurely (and silently) fetched
  into the python-oracledb internal buffer, making those rows unavailable to
  the PL/SQL REF CURSOR parameter::

    refcursor = connection.cursor()
    refcursor.prefetchrows = 0
    refcursor.execute("select ...")
    cursor.callproc("myproc", [refcursor])

* When querying a PL/SQL function that uses PIPE ROW to emit rows at
  intermittent intervals.  By default, several rows needs to be emitted by the
  function before python-oracledb can return them to the application.  Setting
  ``prefetchrows`` to 0 helps give a consistent flow of data to the
  application.

Tuning Fetching from REF CURSORS
--------------------------------

The internal buffering and performance of fetching data from REF CURSORS can be
tuned by setting the value of ``arraysize`` before rows are fetched from the
cursor. The ``prefetchrows`` value is ignored when fetching *from* REF CURSORS.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    ref_cursor = connection.cursor()
    cursor.callproc("myrefcursorproc", [ref_cursor])

    ref_cursor.arraysize = 1000
    print("Sum of IntCol for", num_rows, "rows:")
    for row in ref_cursor:
        sum_rows += row[0]
    print(sum_rows)

The ``arraysize`` value can also be set before calling the procedure:

.. code-block:: python

    ref_cursor = connection.cursor()
    ref_cursor.arraysize = 1000

    cursor.callproc("myrefcursorproc", [ref_cursor])
    for row in ref_cursor:
        . . .

.. _roundtrips:

Also see `Avoiding Premature Prefetching`_.

Database Round-trips
====================

A round-trip is defined as the travel of a message from python-oracledb to the
database and back. Calling each python-oracledb function, or accessing each
attribute, will require zero or more round-trips.  For example, inserting a
simple row involves sending data to the database and getting a success response
back.  This is a round-trip. Along with tuning an application's architecture
and `tuning its SQL statements
<https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=dblatest&id=TGSQL>`__, a general
performance and scalability goal is to minimize `round-trips
<https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=dblatest&id=GUID-9B2F05F9-D841-
4493-A42D-A7D89694A2D1>`__ because they impact application performance and
overall system scalability.

Some general tips for reducing round-trips are:

* Tune :attr:`Cursor.arraysize` and :attr:`Cursor.prefetchrows` for each
  query.
* Use :meth:`Cursor.executemany()` for optimal DML execution.
* Only commit when necessary.  Use :attr:`Connection.autocommit` on the last
  statement of a transaction.
* For connection pools, use a callback to set connection state, see
  :ref:`Session Callbacks for Setting Pooled Connection State
  <sessioncallback>`.
* Make use of PL/SQL procedures which execute multiple SQL statements instead
  of executing them individually from python-oracledb.
* Use scalar types instead of Oracle Database object types.
* Avoid overuse of :meth:`Connection.ping()`.
* Avoid setting :attr:`ConnectionPool.ping_interval` to 0 or a small value.
* When using :ref:`SODA <sodausermanual>`, use pooled connections and enable
  the :ref:`SODA metadata cache <sodametadatacache>`.

Finding the Number of Round-Trips
----------------------------------

Oracle's `Automatic Workload Repository <https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/
lookup?ctx=dblatest&id=GUID-56AEF38E-9400-427B-A818-EDEC145F7ACD>`__
(AWR) reports show 'SQL*Net roundtrips to/from client' and are useful for
finding the overall behavior of a system.

Sometimes you may wish to find the number of round-trips used for a
specific application.  Snapshots of the ``V$SESSTAT`` view taken before
and after doing some work can be used for this:

.. code-block:: python

    # Get the connection's session id
    def get_session_id(connection):
        sql = "select sys_context('userenv','sid') from dual"
        result, = connection.cursor().execute(sql).fetchone()
        return result

     # Get the number of round-trips a session has made so far
     def get_round_trips(systemconn, sid):
         sql = """select
                      ss.value
                  from
                      v$sesstat  ss,
                      v$statname sn
                  where
                      ss.sid = :sid
                      and ss.statistic# = sn.statistic#
                      and sn.name like '%roundtrip%client%'"""
         round_trips, = systemconn.cursor().execute(sql, [sid]).fetchone()
         return round_trips


    systemconn = oracledb.connect(user="system", password=spw, dsn=cs)
    connection = oracledb.connect(user=un, password=pw, dsn=cs)

    sid = get_session_id(connection)
    round_trips_before = get_round_trips(systemconn, sid)

    # Do some "work"
    cursor.execute("select ...")
    rows = cursor.fetchall()

    round_trips_after = get_round_trips(systemconn, sid)

    print(f"Round-trips required for query: {round_trips_after - round_trips_before}")

.. _stmtcache:

Statement Caching
=================

Python-oracledb's :meth:`Cursor.execute()` and :meth:`Cursor.executemany()`
methods use statement caching to make re-execution of statements efficient.
Statement caching lets Oracle Database cursors be used without re-parsing the
statement.  Statement caching also reduces metadata transfer costs between
python-oracledb and the database. Performance and scalability are improved.

The python-oracledb Thick mode uses `Oracle Call Interface statement caching
<https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=dblatest&id=GUID-4947CAE8-1F00-
4897-BB2B-7F921E495175>`__, whereas the Thin mode uses its own implementation.

Each standalone or pooled connection has its own cache of statements with a
default size of 20. The default size of the statement cache can be changed
using the :attr:`defaults.stmtcachesize` attribute. The size can be set when
creating connection pools or standalone connections. In general, set the
statement cache size to the size of the working set of statements being
executed by the application.  To manually tune the cache, monitor the general
application load and the `Automatic Workload Repository <https://www.oracle.
com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=dblatest&id=GUID-56AEF38E-9400-427B-A818-
EDEC145F7ACD>`__ (AWR) "bytes sent via SQL*Net to client" values.  The latter
statistic should benefit from not shipping statement metadata to
python-oracledb.  Adjust the statement cache size to your satisfaction. With
Oracle Database 12c (or later), the Thick mode statement cache size can be
automatically tuned using an :ref:`oraaccess.xml <optclientfiles>` file.

Setting the Statement Cache
---------------------------

The statement cache size can be set globally with
:attr:`defaults.stmtcachesize`:

.. code-block:: python

    import oracledb

    oracledb.defaults.stmtcachesize = 40

The value can be overridden in an :meth:`oracledb.connect()` call, or when
creating a pool with :meth:`oracledb.create_pool()`. For example:

.. code-block:: python

  oracledb.create_pool(user="scott", password=userpwd, dsn="dbhost.example.com/orclpb",
                       min=2, max=5, increment=1, stmtcachesize=50)

When python-oracledb Thick mode uses Oracle Client 21 (or later), changing the
cache size with :meth:`ConnectionPool.reconfigure()` does not immediately
affect connections previously acquired and currently in use. When those
connections are subsequently released to the pool and re-acquired, they will
then use the new value. When the Thick mode uses Oracle Client prior to
version 21, changing the pool's statement cache size has no effect on
connections that already exist in the pool but will affect new connections
that are subsequently created, for example when the pool grows.

Tuning the Statement Cache
--------------------------

In general, set the statement cache to the size of the working set of
statements being executed by the application. :ref:`SODA <sodausermanual>`
internally makes SQL calls, so tuning the cache is also beneficial for SODA
applications.

In python-oracledb Thick mode with Oracle Client Libraries 12c (or later), the
statement cache size can be automatically tuned with the Oracle Client
Configuration :ref:`oraaccess.xml <optclientfiles>` file.

For manual tuning use views like V$SYSSTAT:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT value FROM V$SYSSTAT WHERE name = 'parse count (total)'

Find the value before and after running application load to give the number of
statement parses during the load test. Alter the statement cache size and
repeat the test until you find a minimal number of parses.

If you have Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) reports you can monitor
general application load and the "bytes sent via SQL*Net to client" values.
The latter statistic should benefit from not shipping statement metadata to
python-oracledb. Adjust the statement cache size and re-run the test to find
the best cache size.

Disabling the Statement Cache
-----------------------------

Statement caching can be disabled by setting the cache size to 0:

.. code-block:: python

    oracledb.defaults.stmtcachesize = 0

Disabling the cache may be beneficial when the quantity or order of statements
causes cache entries to be flushed before they get a chance to be
reused. For example if there are more distinct statements than cache
slots, and the order of statement execution causes older statements to
be flushed from the cache before the statements are re-executed.

Disabling the statement cache may also be helpful in test and development
environments.  The statement cache can become invalid if connections remain
open and database schema objects are recreated.  Applications can then receive
errors such as ``ORA-3106``. However, after a statement execution error is
returned once to the application, python-oracledb automatically drops that
statement from the cache. This lets subsequent re-executions of the statement
on that connection to succeed.

When it is inconvenient to pass statement text through an application, the
:meth:`Cursor.prepare()` call can be used to avoid statement re-parsing.
If the ``cache_statement`` parameter in the :meth:`Cursor.prepare()` method is
True and the statement cache size is greater than 0, then the statements will
be added to the cache, if not already present. If the ``cache_statement``
parameter in the :meth:`Cursor.prepare()` method is False and the statement
cache size is greater than 0, then the statement will be removed from the
statement cache (if present) or will not be cached (if not present). The
subsequent ``execute()`` calls use the value None instead of the SQL text.

This feature can prevent a rarely executed statement from flushing a potential
more frequently executed one from a full cache. For example, if a statement
will only ever be executed once:

.. code-block:: python

    cursor.prepare("select user from dual", cache_statement = False)
    cursor.execute(None)

Alternatively,

.. code-block:: python

    sql = "select user from dual"
    cursor.prepare(sql, cache_statement=False)
    cursor.execute(sql)

Statements passed to :meth:`~Cursor.prepare()` are also stored in the statement
cache.

.. _clientresultcache:

Client Result Caching (CRC)
===========================

Python-oracledb applications can use Oracle Database's `Client Result Cache
<https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=dblatest&id=GUID-35CB2592-7588-
4C2D-9075-6F639F25425E>`__.  The CRC enables client-side caching of SQL query
(SELECT statement) results in client memory for immediate use when the same
query is re-executed.  This is useful for reducing the cost of queries for
small, mostly static, lookup tables, such as for postal codes.  CRC reduces
network :ref:`round-trips <roundtrips>`, and also reduces database server CPU
usage.

.. note::

    Client Result Caching is only supported in the python-oracledb Thick mode.
    See :ref:`enablingthick`.

The cache is at the application process level.  Access and invalidation is
managed by the Oracle Client libraries.  This removes the need for extra
application logic, or external utilities, to implement a cache.

CRC can be enabled by setting the `database parameters <https://www.oracle.com
/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=dblatest&id=GUID-A9D4A5F5-B939-48FF-80AE-0228E7314C7D>`__
``CLIENT_RESULT_CACHE_SIZE`` and ``CLIENT_RESULT_CACHE_LAG``, and then
restarting the database, for example:

.. code-block:: sql

    SQL> ALTER SYSTEM SET CLIENT_RESULT_CACHE_LAG = 3000 SCOPE=SPFILE;
    SQL> ALTER SYSTEM SET CLIENT_RESULT_CACHE_SIZE = 64K SCOPE=SPFILE;
    SQL> STARTUP FORCE

CRC can alternatively be configured in an :ref:`oraaccess.xml <optclientfiles>`
or :ref:`sqlnet.ora <optnetfiles>` file on the Python host, see `Client
Configuration Parameters <https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=dblatest
&id=GUID-E63D75A1-FCAA-4A54-A3D2-B068442CE766>`__.

Tables can then be created, or altered, so repeated queries use CRC.  This
allows existing applications to use CRC without needing modification.  For
example:

.. code-block:: sql

    SQL> CREATE TABLE cities (id number, name varchar2(40)) RESULT_CACHE (MODE FORCE);
    SQL> ALTER TABLE locations RESULT_CACHE (MODE FORCE);

Alternatively, hints can be used in SQL statements.  For example:

.. code-block:: sql

    SELECT /*+ result_cache */ postal_code FROM locations
